"Quidstats"
Evan Niessen-Derry, Joshua Zemke

Instructions:
- Make a new team (any name)
- Select "New Game" from main menu
- Select team
- Start recording stats!


Summary:
This shows off the basic structure of our app. 
Not all of the support functionality is fleshed out yet,
but the most critical part (stat-recording screen) works.

Many of the necessary data structures are already in place,
we just have to hook them all together.

Currently, this is only deployed to the website and Josh's
phone. We are looking into a way to deploy our app in an
easily accessible way to members of the quidditch league.

Josh plans to continue working on this implementation even
after the presentation time to make the solution to our 
problem as useful and real as possible.

Note: In the testing process, we have found meteor servers
to be frequently down (probably because the large number
of students hosting projects during finals).
